# Climate-Change-Map

In this repository we created 3 seperate maps, each displaying either a different part of the Texas Coastline or different data.

## Drafts
The Texas Sea Rise was our first iteration of a sea level map, with the subsequent map being the South Padre Sea Level Rise Map.

## Global Sea Level Map
Our final version was the Global Sea Level Map which was based off of an example found by Chad Greene, cited down below. The dataset we used is also cited below.

Our group spun off of the original project prompt and focused more on a presentation to potential clients of our theoretical company. This included us creating unique and effective solutions to combat rising sea levels, with our main solution aiming to create wetlands. As such, our function was not our top priority and was mainly used to showcase an estimat in the rise of sea levels when presenting.
